<h1>Essential Tips for the Statement of Purpose (SOP)</h1>
<p>The document should cover the three sections described below. The SOP should describe you (the applicant), your motivation towards your current academic field, and the direction you would like to pursue. Supporting information about prior projects is encouraged.</p>
<p>Part 1: About yourself (Be Brief)</p>
<p>· Introduce yourself</p>
<p>· What is that one attribute/trait/characteristic of yours that you want to draw attention to, and why is that important?</p>
<p>· Where you draw inspiration from and what motivates/interests you?</p>
<p>Part 2: What are your interests in the field of technology? (Elaborate)</p>
<p>· What is the area/theme of your interest in the field of technology?</p>
<p>· Ideally pose a question and define a problem in that area of interest.</p>
<p>· How would you like to address that problem?</p>
<p>· Related research problems, new and/or improvements in technology that you envision.</p>
<p>· What resources (technology and others) would you seek from Adobe to solve that problem, if any?</p>
<p>Part 3: Summarize your experiences and accomplishments in key projects:</p>
<p>· The title of the project, start &amp; end date, your mentors/collaborators in the project</p>
<p>· Your responsibilities, accomplishments (including anything scholarly), lessons learned</p>
<p>· Write technically, or in the style of your discipline.</p>
<p>· Mention any work/internship experience, especially if you had any kind of responsibility for testing, designing or researching</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Useful Tips</h1>
<p>· Be concise. Essays should be approximately 500 to 1,000 well-selected words (1-2 single space pages in 12-point font) – this is better than more words with less clarity and poor organization.</p>
<p>· The review committee will read between the lines. They will look for self-motivation and competence.</p>
<p>· Emphasize everything from a positive perspective and write in an active, not a passive voice.</p>
<p>· Demonstrate your thoughts by providing examples; don’t just say that you’re a persistent person, show it.</p>
<p>· If you faced personal challenges, write it affirmatively, showing your perseverance in academics despite obstacles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>*Terms and Conditions</h1>
<p>· Only Indian nationals studying in Indian universities are eligible to apply.</p>
<p>· Internship offered at Adobe India office. Terms &amp; conditions of internships for India interns will apply.</p>
<p>· If selected for this scholarship, the winner will not be eligible for any other scholarships from Adobe for the same year.</p>
<p>· Adobe holds the rights to revoke/cancel the scholarship offer to any applicant without prior notice.</p>
<p>· Adobe’s decision will be final in all matters.</p>
